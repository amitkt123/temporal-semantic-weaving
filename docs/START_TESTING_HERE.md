## 🎓 HOW TO TEST WITH YOUR OWN DATA

### Create a Python Script
```python
from main import EnhancedTSW

# Initialize system
tsw = EnhancedTSW()

# Add your experiences (any domain!)
tsw.add_experience("Your first experience")
tsw.add_experience("Related second experience")
tsw.add_experience("Another connection")
# ... add more ...

# Query the system
result = tsw.query("Your question here")
print(result['insight'])                    # The answer
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.0%}")  # How confident
print(result['evidence'])                   # Supporting experiences
```

### Or Use Interactive Mode
```bash
python interactive_test.py

# Then type:
> add My first experience
> add Another experience
> ask What connects these?
> stats
> exit
```

## 🔍 WHAT MAKES IT WORK

The system uses:

1. **Semantic Embeddings** - Converts text to 384-dimensional vectors using SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)

2. **Quantum-Inspired Memory** - Experiences are represented as semantic "waves" that:
   - Interfere with each other constructively or destructively
   - Create entanglements when similar
   - Crystallize into patterns

3. **Resonance Field** - Central field manages:
   - Wave interference calculations
   - Resonance detection for queries
   - Pattern crystallization
   - Temporal decay effects

4. **Query Processing** - When you ask a question:
   - Encodes query as semantic wave
   - Finds resonances with stored experiences
   - Returns most similar memories + confidence score

---

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTPUT RANGES

When testing, expect approximately:

| Metric | Typical Range | Meaning |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Field Energy | 15-50 | Total resonance in system |
| Entanglements | 2-4× experiences | Semantic connections |
| Crystals | 0-5 for 10 exp | Discovered patterns |
| Amplitude | 0.1-0.5 | Wave strength |
| Confidence | 60-100% | Query certainty |
| Collapse Prob | 1-10% | Query stability |

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS

You know the system is working when:

✅ **Entanglements appear** as you add related experiences
✅ **Crystals form** when patterns repeat
✅ **High confidence** (75%+) for focused queries
✅ **Evidence matches** your query intent
✅ **Field energy increases** with more experiences
✅ **Queries find connections** you might not have noticed

---

## 🛠️ IF SOMETHING SEEMS SLOW

The system processes semantic embeddings which takes a moment. This is normal:

- First run: ~2-3 seconds (loading model)
- Adding experience: ~0.5-1 second each
- Querying: ~0.5 seconds
- Total for full test: ~10-30 seconds

This is expected behavior with neural network models.
